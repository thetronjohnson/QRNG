# QRNG
Quantum Random Number Generator generates a random integer number using Qiskit.
QRNG works on the principle of superposition.
The Quantum Circuit makes the qubits go into a state of superposition and then measures the qubits
resulting in a random binary string which is converted to an integer

- QASM Simulator produces an 8 bit random number
- to use IBMQ backends, you need to create an account on IBMQ Experience and load your account
- I'll probably make this into a web app if I get time
